**Humanity has been innovating for thousands of years** to ease daily life. Here are examples of two key technologies we often overlook, misunderstand and undervalue.

**Physical Keys:**
The wooden pin lock was invented in Mesopotamia about 6,000 years ago when the first rudimentary key-and-lock system was created (4000 B.C.) in the area of modern-day Iraq.

**Email:**
Email first entered limited use in the 1960s and by the mid-1970s had taken the form now recognized as modern email. That's  when Ray Tomlinson, an American computer scientist, launched a new communications era by placing the @ symbol  in emails to connect the username with the domain-name address.  The first email was sent between two machines that were literally side-by-side.

To understand email's impact, consider this: According to a 2018 study by London-based Radicati Group, there are an estimated 3.8 billion global email users in 2019, representing more than half of the world's population.

Here's a simple way to gauge the relevance of the two technologies discussed above:<br>
**How many keys and email accounts do you have?** <br><br>
